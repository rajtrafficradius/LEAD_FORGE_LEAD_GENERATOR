Lead Generation Automation Tool — V5.4
=======================================
A production-ready lead generation tool that discovers businesses via keyword research,
finds their websites, and enriches contacts with names, roles, emails, and phone numbers.

V5.4 Enhancements:
- NEW partition-based sorting: Name+Email+Phone → Name+Phone → Name+Email → Phone → Email
- Smart email classifier: name-matching + company-matching + OpenAI AI agent
- Enhanced OpenAI prompt with explicit name/company cross-referencing criteria
- 50+ industries in dropdown (was 27) with full keyword libraries
- TOP CSV now includes ALL leads in new sort order (no personal-email-only filter)

V5.3 Features (inherited):
- Company/domain/LinkedIn name extraction, name abbreviation dictionary
- Practical full-name resolution using data already collected

V5.2-V5.1-V5 Features (inherited):
- _lead_is_complete fix, ThreadPoolExecutor (8 workers), skip-if-complete
- Contact-info enrichment, Lusha fix, personal email inference

Pipeline: SEMrush Keywords → SEMrush/SerpApi Domain Discovery → Apollo/Lusha/Web Scraping Enrichment → OpenAI Verification → CSV Export

Requirements: requests, beautifulsoup4
Target: Python 3.11+ / PyCharm 2025.3
